# Gerardo Curiel Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, a set of config files to set up a *NIX system
with my personal preferences.

## Installation

`git clone git://github.com/gcuriel/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
`cd ~/.dotfiles`
`sh install.sh `

## Environment 

I use this setup on Linux and Mac OSX systems. I use ZSH as my preferred shell,
but there's some older bash files around too. Really, you should switch to
ZSH, just change your shell with the following command:

` chsh -s /bin/zsh `

and you're all set!.

The environment is in the lines of Python, Django, homebrew, Vim, Git,
Mercurial, OSX/Linux. 

## Features
